How to use
Starting at the welcome page, National Parks Finder is a simple to use app.  Weather you are in your home state, planning a vacation, or just wondering what some of our parks and other national treasures are like.  From the Welcome Page, you will find our easy to follow Navigation Bar on the top of the screen, and this will follow you throughout your visit to the app. From here you will click on either the easy to find button on the bottom of the page,  located below the scrolling photos, or the link on top to enter the National Parks Finder page.  Here you simply select the state from the pull-down menu at the top select any of the fifty (50) state or the District of Columbia, and find the national treasures in the area, along with photos (powered by google places) and the current weather conditions (powered by WeatherBit)

We would love to hear about your experiences in these national treasures, you can share them with us at any by clicking on the Join us page, we will not share your personal information with anyone.
